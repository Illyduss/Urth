Building a MUD(Multi-User Dungeon) in Python

===================================Current Events==========================================
**Pulled down the main game.py as I was going to upload an updated version with threading, 
but some more work on it is still needed. So I will continue to play with it until it is just
right, but I do believe I am one step closer to getting the time in test.py working.

Currently I am working on a time system in the test.py file and trying to figure out
how to get my Room.py file to print out different sections of the .json depending on
the counter in my test.py.

I created the timer in test.py because it is causing some problems. Right now my time
r is running over my command prompt and so I believe I'll have to introduce threading,
but since I am new to coding I have to do some reading. If anyone has some advice on 
threading or how to get this timer to run in the background then that would be great.

========================================Basic Concept===========================================
I'm trying this first in text and then later maybe as a graphical game. What I'm look
ing to build is a game that draws heavily from real life of the 1300-1400s, mixed with
some fantasy for fun. Instead of creating just another D&D port, I will be creating my
monsters and mythos off of fables and old legends from the time. So evils are nasty 
little buggers and dwarves hang out in graveyards. Furthermore, magic will be very 
limited with a random roll, 1 out of 100 (maybe?), to make things a little fun. Also
the combat system will be a lot more complex with things like spears having a huge 
advantage over smaller weapons like daggers from a distance, but daggers having the ad
vantage up close or armors providing better protection against some weapons than others
or even still different types of arrows being better against different types of armor, 
i.e. bodkin arrow is super strong against chainmain but against plate or even cloth it 
has no where near the same affect. Lastly characters will have only one life, but upon
death the account will gain a point which can be used during creation to gain a genetic 
benefit toward the player's next character.

===========================================Why=============================================
Why a game?
I thought it would be fun to learn coding that way, turns out it is harder than some of
my other scripts.

Why in Python and not C like all the others?
M-O-N-T-Y   P-Y-T-H-O-N, I heard that was the reason for the langauge being called 
Python and if you are nerdy enough to play a MUD then I'm pretty possitive that you'll
understand why.
